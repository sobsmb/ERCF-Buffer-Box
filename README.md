## Notes
* Attach the bearings to the spool holders using the M5 x 16mm Flat Head screws and on the flat side add a M5 washer to offset the bearing from the 3d print a little, see photo below.
* I printed almost everything in ABS/ASA but for the "Bearing Holder.stl" PETG may be a better choice
* Moved the ERCF outside of the box as it was a pain in the arse to clean it, or deal with issues with the ERCF while it was in the box.
* Created a PTFT Quick Connect so I can more easily pull the ercf away from the filament box
* For the PTFT Quick Connect print the Female piece and the cap and then glue them together (Super Glue works great), see image below.
* Under the box I added some TPU feet so when I pull the box off the wall I can set it down and its not damaging anything on the bottom of the box
* Glue to "TPU washer" for the spool holder into the void of the "60mm Roller" with a little super glue to prevent it from spinning. Use Softer TPU. You also may need to clip a little off of each finger. This is used to prevent the spool from free spinning

## Wiring
I will not provide wiring instructions because if you have built a Voron you can probably figure this out on your own, plus your setup is going to be greatly different than mine. 

## Misc

I did include some misc parts that I created for my setup that you are welcome to use.<br>
<br>
If you use the [Voron 2.4 Canopy](https://www.printables.com/model/568090-voron-24-canopy) and have a [BTT PITFT50](https://a.co/d/5EXvKxF)<br>
See: /Misc/Corner.stl and /Misc/PITFT50 Mount.stl<br>
<br>
To make wiring easier I used some [14 pin Micro-Fit 3.0 mm connector](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832548943535.html)<br>
See: /Misc/Back Plate.stl  and /Misc/Port.stl  (P.S. I have a Voron 2.4 350) so the Back Plate may not fit yours
